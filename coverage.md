## Overview

**Requires [XDEBUG 2.0+](https://xdebug.org/docs/install/)**, or [PCOV](https://github.com/krakjoe/pcov), or [PHPDBG](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.phpdbg.php).

Code coverage in Pest tells you which lines of code your test
suite executes and which lines it doesn’t. Of course, PHPUnit
offers you a beautiful section about this topic: [Code Coverage Analysis](https://phpunit.readthedocs.io/en/9.5/code-coverage-analysis.html).

> If you're running Xdebug you need to make sure that coverage is enabled in Xdebug. The easiest way to do this is to set the `XDEBUG_MODE` environment
> variable to `coverage` before running your tests.
> e.g. `XDEBUG_MODE=coverage ./vendor/bin/pest --coverage`

## Extra Options

Now, in this section, we are going to see the extra options that Pest offers.

### `--coverage`

The `--coverage` option, gives you a human-readable code coverage
directly on the console.

```
./vendor/bin/pest --coverage
```

Keep in mind: the percentage displayed concerns the number of lines
of source code that has been tested/executed.

The numbers marked in red (if any) relate to the lines not covered by your current test suite, these are displayed using the line numbers. If there are multiple lines without coverage these numbers will be displayed with `..` between them. For example, if you are missing coverage on line 52, you will see `52` in red, whereas if there is missing coverage between lines 52 and 60 you will see `52..60`.

You can combine this with other coverage options from PHPUnit such as --coverage-xml or --coverage-html.

### `--min`

Of course, you can always combine the `--coverage` option
with the `--min` option to configure minimum threshold enforcement
for coverage results. If the thresholds are not met, Pest will return failure.

```
./vendor/bin/pest --coverage --min=90
```

## Filters

By default, the PHPUnit [configuration file generated](https://github.com/pestphp/pest/blob/master/stubs/init/phpunit.xml) by Pest initialization will include directory coverage for the `app` and `src` directories.

Although this covers most libraries and applications, you may need to add more directories to be covered. To do this, you'll need to add a new `<directory>` element inside the `coverage.include` section.

If you are experiencing a `Coverage not found in path: vendor/pestphp/.temp/coverage.php` exception message, for example, if your code is under a `lib` directory, you'll need to apply the following change to your `phpunit.xml`.

```diff
<coverage processUncoveredFiles="true">
    <include>
        <directory suffix=".php">./app</directory>
        <directory suffix=".php">./src</directory>
+       <directory suffix=".php">./lib</directory>
    </include>
</coverage>
```
